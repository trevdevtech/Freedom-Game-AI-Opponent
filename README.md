# Freedom-Game-AI-Opponent
An AI assignment where an AI utilizes a recursive minimax algorithm after traversing state space in order to make a highly optimal move.

## Requirements
Python 3.6+

## Usage
python3 freedom-driver.py [boardsize] [AI difficulty]

## Run/Execute
```bash
python3 freedom.py 8 4
```

# PLAYING THE GAME:

Color Scheme is green/red because its easier to see in most terminals where green will substitute white and red will substitute black (green = white and red = black)

Enter board positions as (row col), without paraenthesis. Ex:

```bash
Enter move: 1 2
```

Board origin is top left corner at position 0 0
